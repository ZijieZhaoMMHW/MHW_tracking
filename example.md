# An example to normalize MHW tracks
 Here we provide an example to normalize the MHW tracks identified using the spatially coherent method provided by Sun et al. (2023).

## The 2015-2016 Tasman Sea Marine Heatwaves
The data file `tracks_tas.mat` contains a three-dimensional dataset (Lon–Lat–Time) generated by the function `hwtrack.m`. It is stored as a structured array with the following contents:
```matlab
load('tracks_tas.mat');
>> tracks

tracks = 

          struct:

          day: [230×1 double]
         xloc: {230×1 cell}
         yloc: {230×1 cell}
      ori_day: 12329
    ori_order: 3
    split_num: [38×1 double]
    split_day: [38×1 double]
```
This record represents a marine heatwave (MHW) track lasting 230 days, with temporal information stored in `day` and the corresponding grid-cell indices along longitude and latitude stored in `xloc` and `yloc`, respectively. 
The event begins on the 12,329th day of the record. Given that the MHWs were detected over the period 1982–2020, this corresponds to an original calendar date of October 3, 2015. The MHWs are detected in a 400*160 (Lon*Lat) domain indicated by the location data `lonlat_used.mat`

You can use the following codes to draw a quick GIF to visualize this event.
```matlab

```
